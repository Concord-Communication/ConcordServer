> For API documentation, please visit the respective [REST](../rest-api/) and [Websocket](../websocket-api/) pages.

The Concord Server is a high-performance asynchronous web server that supports both a rich HTTP REST API, and a real-time Websocket API for event propagation, for the single purpose of creating a real-time communication platform that does away with those pesky limitations imposed by commercial apps.

**Use Concord Server for whatever you want.**
